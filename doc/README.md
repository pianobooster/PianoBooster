## Presentation

*PianoBooster* is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment and at
the same time learning the basics of reading musical notation.  The difference
between playing along to a CD or a standard midi file is that *PianoBooster*
listens and follows what you are playing on a midi piano keyboard.

### Introduction

*PianoBooster* is a free (Open Source) program that plays Standard Midi Files
and allows you to change the speed of playback
and transpose the music etc.
There is a scrolling musical stave that shows the notes for just one part
from all the parts in the complete musical arrangement.

*PianoBooster* has been designed to allow you to play along on a midi piano
keyboard with the scrolling notes shown on the screen. The notes you press on
the keyboard appear as coloured lines on the musical stave, the colour of which
depends whether you have pressed the right or wrong note.

A different musical instrument sound is used for your playing depending whether
you are playing the right or wrong notes. This feature also allows
PianoBooster to be used with printed sheet music so you can hear if you are
playing the right notes while at the same time keeping your eyes on the printed
score. The music accompaniment will automatically wait for you to find and play
the correct notes in the piece.

*Piano Booster* is piano teaching software that can provide piano lessons for

It can be used for teaching music theory and is useful for piano practice and

### Timing markers

Timing markers show whether you are playing ahead or behind of the beat.
They appear as white crosses that are drawn over the note.
Timing markers are new in version 0.6.2.
