For **Skip To My Loo** start with both thumbs on **middle C** and then use one finger for each white note on the piano. So for the first two notes which are **E** you should use the **middle finger** of your right hand.

This piece introduces the use of **both hands** as the melody goes across **middle C**.

**Hint:** _For the notes in the **treble clef** you always use your **right hand** and for the **base clef** your **left hand**. Make sure you always keep using the correct finger for each note._
