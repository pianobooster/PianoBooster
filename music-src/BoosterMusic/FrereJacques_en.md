For **Frere Jacques** introduces the use of playing both hands together with a very simple left hand part. First practice the **left hand** and **right hand** parts separately. Then when ready reduce the **speed to 70%** and try **both hands** together. Again start with **both thumbs** on **Middle C**.

**Hint:** _Practice the **left hand** and **right hand** parts separately._
