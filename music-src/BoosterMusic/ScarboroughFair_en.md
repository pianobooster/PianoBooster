**Scarborough Fair** spans a range of eight notes and so you will have to move fingers up the piano. Use the fingering that you feel comfortable with but ensure that you **use all your fingers** (of your right hand).

**Hint:** _Don't think about what fingers to use, just use the fingering that **comes naturally to you**._
