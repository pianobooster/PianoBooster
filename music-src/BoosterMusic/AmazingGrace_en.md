**Amazing Grace** introduces the key of **F major** which has a **single Flat - Bb**. Again the flat symbol is not normally shown on the score when playing Bb. Practice both hands separately at first and then when ready reduce the speed to 70% when trying both hands for the first time.

**Hint:** _Reduce the speed to 70% when trying both hands for the first time._
