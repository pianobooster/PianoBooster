Now we are going to play using your **left hand** the **F major chord**. The three notes of a chord are called a triad and this chord has the same shape as the C major chord we played earlier but played on a different part of the piano.

Use your **little finger** on the left hand for **F**, your **middle finger** for **A** and your **thumb** for **C**.

**Hint:** _If you don't know the names of the notes on the score then turn on **Show Note Names** from the PianoBooster **Setup/Preferences** menu._
