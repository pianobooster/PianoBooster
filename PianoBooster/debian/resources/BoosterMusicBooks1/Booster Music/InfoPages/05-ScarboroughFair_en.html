<b>Scarborough Fair</b> spans a range of eight notes and so you will have to move fingers up the piano.
Use the fingering that you feel comfortable with but ensure that you <b>use all your fingers</b> (of your right hand).

Don't think about what fingers to use, just use the fingering that <b>comes naturally to you</b>.
