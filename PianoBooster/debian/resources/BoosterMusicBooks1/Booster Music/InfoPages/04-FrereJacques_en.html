For <b>Frere Jacques</b> introduces the use of playing both hands together with a very simple left hand part.
First practice the <b>left hand</b> and <b>right hand</b> parts separately.
Then when ready reduce the <b>speed to 70%</b> and try <b>both hands</b> together.
Again start with <b>both thumbs</b> on <b>Middle C</b>.
