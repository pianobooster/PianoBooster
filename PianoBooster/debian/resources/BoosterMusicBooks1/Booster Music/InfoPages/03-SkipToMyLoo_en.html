<p>
For <b>Skip To My Loo</b> start with both thumbs on <b>middle C</b> and then use one finger for each white note on the piano.
So for the first two notes which are <b>E</b> you should use the <b>middle finger</b> of your right hand.
</p>
<p> This piece introduces the use of <b>both hands</b> as the melody goes across <b>middle C</b></p>

<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Hint:</b> <i>
For the notes in the <b>treble clef</b> you always use your <b>right hand</b>
and for the <b>base clef</b> your <b>left hand</b>.

Make sure you always keep using the correct finger for each note.
