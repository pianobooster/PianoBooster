pianobooster (educational music software)

PianoBooster is a fun way of playing along with a musical accompaniment
and at the same time learning the basics of reading musical notation. The
difference between playing along to a CD or a standard midi file is
that PianoBooster listens and follows what you are playing on a midi
piano keyboard.
